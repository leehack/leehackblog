In order to give the entire developer community a chance to participate live, we're happy to announce that both keynote presentations will be streamed live. To watch, just go to http://www.youtube.com/GoogleDevelopers at the start of the keynotes each day. We recommend watching on a high-speed connection for the best quality.<br /><br />Here’s the schedule for the keynotes at I/O — it’s also available on our agenda page:<br />Day 1 Keynote: Wednesday, May 19, 9:00 -10:30am PT<br />Day 2 Keynote: Thursday, May 20, 8:30-10:00am PT<br />Both keynote sessions feature exciting new technologies, so be sure to mark your calendars!<br /><br />Posted by Christine Tsai, Google Developer Team"
